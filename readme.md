# Completionist++ Tracker

## Description

Completionist++ Tracker replaces the in-game Joker Sticker progress such that it only tracks gold stickers. This makes your C++ progress more clear.

## Installation

Follow the Steamodded installation guide for your respective operating system [here](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki). Don't forget to enable achievements in the Mods menu in-game.

Then download the [latest release](https://github.com/AndyWilliams682/cpp-tracking/releases/latest), unzip the contents into your Mods folder (created as part of the Steamodded instructions). You should end up with `Mods\cpp-tracking`
